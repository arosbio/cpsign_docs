# Securing your data


Encryption can be used to protect datasets, generated descriptors (e.g. signatures) and predictor models. This is possible by purchasing an extension to the CPSign software, please contact [Aros Bio](mailto:ola.spjuth@arosbio.com) for further details. It is also possible to implement this yourself by implementing the interface `com.arosbio.encryption.EncryptionSpecification.java`, further information can be found in the [encryption-api project on GitHub](https://github.com/arosbio/cpsign/tree/main/encrypt-api) and in the {ref}`encryption-extension` section.
