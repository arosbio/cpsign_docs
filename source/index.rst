CPSign is a tool for modeling in cheminformatics using Conformal Prediction and probabilistic predictions using the Signatures molecular descriptor and Support Vector Machines (SVM). CPSign leverages `CDK <https://cdk.github.io/>`_ for cheminformatics, and uses `LibLinear <https://liblinear.bwaldvogel.de/>`_ and `LibSVM <https://github.com/jeffheaton/libsvm-java>`_ for machine learning tasks.
