Explain

To make it easier to work with the CLI without requiring going back and forth to this website to get more detailed explanations about parameters, the :code:`explain` program can give further information about parameters than given in the normal usage texts. Sometimes the usage texts give information about the exact command to run to get information, but otherwise you can run :code:`explain` without any arguments or :code:`explain --help` to check which parameters or key terms that can be used by the command.
